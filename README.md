# syncope-docker

This is a sample project to have an Apache Syncope project in a Docker container.

You will find two ways to run Apache Syncope with docker. The simplest is to use the `docker-compose` utility; to do so you have to checkout the `syncope_docker_deb` branch of this project.

This is only a sample (and simple) project, a lot of work could be done to improve several aspects of installation. The aim of this project is to provide a valid (and really implementable) solution and alternative to canonical Apache Syncope installations.
We are open to support and new contributors ;)
